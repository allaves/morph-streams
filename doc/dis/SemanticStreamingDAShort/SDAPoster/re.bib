Most of the previous approaches regard only relational or XML based streams but do not cover semantically richer RDF based stream elements. In our work, we extend SPARQL, the W3C recommendation for an RDF query language, to process RDF data streams. To describe the semantics of our enhancement, we extended the logical SPARQL algebra for stream processing on the foundation of a temporal relational algebra based on multi-sets and provide an algorithm to transform SPARQL queries to the new extended algebra. For each logical algebra operator, we define executable physical counterparts. To show the feasibility of our approach, we implemented it within our Odysseus framework in the context of wind power plant monitoring.},

The fact that a software system must process and react to continual inputs from many sources (e.g., sensors) rather than from human operators requires one to rethink the fundamental architecture of a DBMS for this application area. In this paper, we present Aurora, a new DBMS that is currently under construction at Brandeis University, Brown University, and M.I.T. We describe the basic system architecture, a stream-oriented set of operators, optimization tactics, and support for real-time operation.},

@article{Chen_00,
    abstract = {Continuous queries are persistent queries that allow users to receive new results when they become available. While continuous query systems can transform a passive web into an active environment, they need to be able to support millions of queries due to the scale of the Internet. No existing systems have achieved this level of scalability. NiagaraCQ addresses this problem by grouping continuous queries based on the observation that many web queries share similar structures. Grouped queries can share the common computation, tend to fit in memory and can reduce the I/O cost significantly. Furthermore, grouping on selection predicates can eliminate a large number of unnecessary query invocations. Our grouping technique is distinguished from previous group optimization approaches in the following ways. First, we use an incremental group optimization strategy with dynamic re-grouping. New queries are added to existing query groups, without having to regroup already installed queries. Second, we use a query-split scheme that requires minimal changes to a general-purpose query engine. Third, NiagaraCQ groups both change-based and timer-based queries in a uniform way. To insure that NiagaraCQ is scalable, we have also employed other techniques including incremental evaluation of continuous queries, use of both pull and push models for detecting heterogeneous data source changes, and memory caching. This paper presents the design of NiagaraCQ system and gives some experimental results on the system's performance and scalability.},

As such, we address the problem of how to develop a comprehensive optimizer for an expressive declarative continuous query language over acquisitional streams as one of finding extensions to a classical distributed query processing architecture that contend with the peculiarities of sensor networks as an environment for distributed computing.},
